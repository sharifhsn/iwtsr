# Optimization Strategies for the Hill-Hill-Holder Algorithm

This document outlines potential strategies for optimizing the performance of the Rust implementation of the Hill, Hill, and Holder algorithm.

## 1. Identifying the Computational Bottleneck

The first step in any optimization effort is to identify where the most time is spent. The algorithm's structure is a decision tree that leads to one of several outcomes:

1.  **Trivial Cases (Extremely Fast):** `Normal`, `Lognormal`, `ST`, `Constant`. These are calculated directly with a few mathematical operations. They are not a target for optimization.
2.  **SU Fit (Moderately Fast):** The `su_fit` function contains a single iterative loop that runs at most 50 times. The math inside is complex but self-contained. This is moderately expensive but still very fast in practice.
3.  **SB Fit (Very Slow):** The `sb_fit` function is, by a massive margin, the primary computational bottleneck. Its structure reveals why:
    *   It contains an outer Newton-Raphson loop that can run up to 50 times.
    *   **Crucially, it calls the `mom` function on every single iteration.**
    *   The `mom` function itself contains a nested loop structure for numerical integration that can run for hundreds of iterations.

In a worst-case scenario for a difficult SB fit, the number of innermost operations is on the order of **50 (sb_fit) * 500 (mom) = 25,000** complex loop bodies. The original paper notes that a difficult SB fit can take **~500 times longer** than an SU fit.

**Conclusion:** Any significant optimization efforts **must** be focused on the `sb_fit` -> `mom` execution path.

## 2. Options for Algorithmic Speed Optimization

### Non-Parallel Strategies

Before considering parallelism, several algorithmic improvements are possible:

*   **Compiler Optimizations (Baseline):** The single most important step is to compile in release mode (`cargo build --release`). The Rust compiler will automatically perform powerful optimizations like vectorization (SIMD), loop unrolling, and function inlining. The current code is written in a style that is highly amenable to these optimizations.

*   **Lookup Tables (LUTs) - High Potential:** The `mom(g, d)` function is a *pure function*: for the same `g` and `d` inputs, it always produces the same output moments. This makes it a perfect candidate for memoization or, even better, a pre-computed Lookup Table (LUT).
    *   **Implementation:** A one-time process could compute the results of `mom` for a grid of `(g, d)` values and store them in a static table.
    *   **Runtime:** At runtime, `sb_fit` would perform a fast bilinear interpolation on this table instead of calling `mom`.
    *   **Trade-off:** This trades a one-time pre-computation cost and increased memory usage for a massive runtime speedup, effectively replacing thousands of calculations with a simple table lookup.

### Parallelism & Concurrency Strategies

The internal logic of the algorithm is **highly sequential**, making it a poor candidate for internal parallelism.

*   **Why Internal Parallelism is Not Feasible:**
    *   **`sb_fit` Loop:** The Newton-Raphson method is inherently sequential. Iteration `n+1` depends directly on the results from iteration `n`.
    *   **`mom` Loops:** The loops inside `mom` are also sequential. The outer loop refines an integration step, and the inner loop is a series summation.

The true opportunity for parallelism is not *inside* the `hhh` function, but in running **multiple calls to `hhh` in parallel**.

#### Application-Level Data Parallelism (Highly Recommended)

In nearly all real-world use cases (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations, financial modeling, scientific research), one needs to fit distributions for thousands or millions of independent datasets. This is an "embarrassingly parallel" problem.

**1. Data Parallelism with Rayon**

This is the most idiomatic, simple, and effective solution in Rust for CPU-bound tasks. By using Rayon's `par_iter()`, you can process a collection of input moments on a thread pool, scaling automatically to all available CPU cores.

**Example:**
```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;

struct InputMoments { /* ... */ }

let inputs: Vec<InputMoments> = // Vector with thousands of inputs
    /* ... */;

// By simply changing .iter() to .par_iter(), the work is parallelized.
let results: Vec<_> = inputs
    .par_iter()
    .map(|input| hhh(input.mean, input.std_dev, input.skew, input.kurtosis))
    .collect();
```
This approach offers a near-linear speedup with the number of CPU cores for large workloads and requires minimal code changes.

**2. Asynchronous Runtimes (Tokio, async-std)**

While primarily designed for I/O-bound tasks, async runtimes can manage CPU-bound workloads using `spawn_blocking`. This moves the `hhh` call to a dedicated thread pool, preventing it from stalling an async event loop.

**Example (with Tokio):**
```rust
let handles = inputs.into_iter().map(|input| {
    tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
        hhh(input.mean, input.std_dev, input.skew, input.kurtosis)
    })
}).collect::<Vec<_>>();

let results = futures::future::join_all(handles).await;
```
This is a more complex solution and is only recommended if you need to integrate this computational workload into a larger asynchronous application.

## Final Recommendation

1.  **Primary Strategy:** The most significant and practical speedup will come from **application-level data parallelism using Rayon**. Structure your application to process large batches of inputs at once.
2.  **Secondary Strategy:** For an even greater single-threaded speedup, especially if `sb_fit` is frequently called, implementing a **Lookup Table (LUT)** to replace the `mom` function would be highly effective.
